# Iain Weir Github Profile

## üë• User Story:

As a wise and enterprising member of my organisation I want to learn as much as I need to about Iain Weir before making contact via my preferred communication method so that I can take credit for the benefits that he will bring to our team when we recruit his skills.

## ü§ù Acceptance Criteria

- Given that I may not know anything about Iain Weir, I need to be told that he is an experienced product manager, data & business analyst; adept at working with Agile processes and has a passion for seeking out new perspectives and thinking creatively. When I know this I can then choose whether or not to learn more.
- Given that I want to learn more about Iain Weir and I acknowledge that GitHub isn't the place for a full employment history I need to be presented with a link to his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ifweir/" target="_blank">LinkedIn Profile</a> that when I click will then open Iain Weir's profile on LinkedIn where I can connect with him if I so choose.
- Given that I am still here I want to learn a bit more about Iain's coding ability which is probably best described as intermediate level with python, html, css with Iain having built and deployed various websites over the years as well as recently undertaking a data science bootcamp which focused heavily on python and the pydata stack (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn). When I click on [repositories](https://github.com/shutteritch?tab=repositories) I will then be able to see some examples of this.
- Given that I now want to contact Iain Weir, when I click [HERE](mailto:ifweir@gmail.com?subject=Hello%20Iain!&body=Hi%20Iain%2C%0D%0A%0D%0AI%20found%20your%20profile%20on%20GitHub%20and%20thought%20I'd%20say%20Hi!) it will then open my email client with some suggested text that I can delete and replace with my own.
