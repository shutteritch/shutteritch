Learning my lessons, day by day.

Will come back and post more things here soon but for now why not have a look at [My Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ifweir/) 

(if you *really* need to see some code, why not check out the [task manager project](https://github.com/shutteritch/finalCapstone/blob/main/task_manager.py) I completed at the end of a series of basic python tutorials - I'm actually quite proud of the documentation ðŸ¤“)
